# Grand Tour GPS tracks

Each file in this folder is a GPX-formatted GPS route for a leg of [my
version of the Grand Tour of
Switzerland](http://localhost:8080/2021/02/grand-tour-of-switzerland/) I took
in September 2020. The `00-grand-tour.gpx` is a merged version of all the
others.

The `hires` folder contains higher-resolution versions of each track. These
aren't embedded in the blog post because of their large filesize (this does get
compressed down 10x or so, but that still adds up).

The high-resolution tracks were created using a mixture of Google Maps
(converted to GPX using [Maps to GPX](https://mapstogpx.com/)) and
[Furkout](https://trips.furkot.com/), and the lower-resolution versions were
made from these using [GPSBabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org/), reducing the number
of points down to a few hundred.
