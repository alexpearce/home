description: How to creating and set up a virtual machine for running acron jobs in the CERN network.
---

Running periodic jobs with Kerberos authentication on CERN machines is easy 
with [acron][acron].
We showed [how to use acron][acron-tut] in a previous post, and now we're going 
to set up a [virtual machine][vm] in the CERN network that can accept such 
acron jobs.

Having our own virtual machine (VM) is like having our own private server. 
We're able to install whatever software we like on it, and the resources 
allocated to the VM are available only to us. This is in comparison with 
something like [lxplus][lxplus], CERN's computing cluster that most users use 
for interactive work, on which the choice of software is fixed, and the speed 
of a machine is subject to what the other users using it are doing.

Combined with acron, we can create a machine that can run almost any piece of 
software we like, whenever we like, without us having to log in and execute it 
manually.

We'll start by creating the VM, and then we'll install the software that's 
needed to run the acron jobs. We'll finish by showing that everything works.

## Creating the virtual machine

The [CERN OpenStack][openstack] instance allows CERN users to start virtual 
machines for their own use.
After [logging in][openstack-login], you'll be able to see what resources you 
have available.

![The homepage of the CERN OpenStack instance after logging in](/img/creating-a-vm-for-acron-jobs/openstack-resources.png)

Luckily, CERN provide a very nice [guide for creating a CERN OpenStack 
instance][openstack-guide], so I won't go through the details here. The 
important thing is to first [sign up for the CERN OpenStack 
service][openstack-subscribe], and then to [add a keypair][openstack-keypair].
Once that's done, you'll want to click on 'Launch Instance', from the 
'Instances' page, and to end up with a screen that looks something like this:

![Creating an OpenStack instance](/img/creating-a-vm-for-acron-jobs/openstack-create-instance.png)

Specifically, make sure to select 'Boot from image' and then choose the 'CC7 
Extra' image that has the latest date (which is `2016-02-09`, as of the date of 
this post). I've called my VM 'acron-test', but you should pick a different 
name and make to take a note of it: this name is what you'll use to access your 
machine with `ssh acron-test.cern.ch`.

(The difference between the 'Base' and 'Extra' images is that the 'Extra' image 
comes with a bunch of CERN-specific packages pre-installed, as well as already 
coming with software that's very commonly used at CERN such as [AFS][afs].
The definitions of the various images can be found in the 
[cernops/openstack-image-tools GitHub repository][openstack-images])

After clicking 'Launch', it will take 5â€“10 minutes for the VM to be created and 
ready for us to log in.

### Logging in

Once the VM status is 'Active', you can try logging in. For security reasons, 
VMs are only accessible from inside the CERN network unless you request 
otherwise, so you'll need to log in to a machine in the CERN network, such as 
`lxplus.cern.ch`, before logging in to your VM.

```bash
# From a machine inside the CERN network
$ ssh centos@acron-test.cern.ch
```

The default user is `centos`, so we tell SSH to assume that user.
If you see errors about permissions, you need to make sure your using the same 
[SSH keypair you set up in OpenStack][openstack-keypair].
If you get a timeout error, the machine is probably still booting, so just wait 
a while and try again.
If everything goes well, you'll end up with a prompt on the VM.

```
[centos@acron-test ~]$
```

Before we move on, we'll just add the CERN user you usually use to the VM, so 
that you don't need to SSH in as `centos`, and so you can SSH using your usual 
authentication method (like passwords or Kerberos tokens).

```bash
[centos@acron-test ~]$ sudo yum install -y cern-config-users
[centos@acron-test ~]$ sudo cern-config-users --setup-all
[centos@acron-test ~]$ su - your_username
```

The first command looks in the [CERN LanDB][landb] to see who owns the machine 
(that's you!), and then [sets up the appropriate user account][cc7-setup].
The second command logs you in as that user on the VM (you'll need to enter 
your password). I found that the second step was necessary before I could log 
in to the VM from another machine.

You can now log off the VM, and try logging in using your regular username.

```bash
# On another CERN machine, such as lxplus
$ ssh your_username@acron-test.cern.ch
```

Now we're ready to install the software needed for our VM to run acron jobs!

## Dependencies and configuration

For this section, make sure you're logged in to the VM we just made, with the CERN 
username you normally use.
There is a [guide for setting up a machine to accept acron 
jobs][acron-host-guide] by CERN, and we're going follow that here pretty 
closely. Take note: from now on, *all commands should be run on the VM*.

First, we make sure that the machine is correctly configured to retrieve 
Kerberos tokens, which are used to allow the acron jobs to access user's files.

```bash
# Say 'yes' to accepting sudo responsibility (scary!)
$ sudo yum install -y cern-get-keytab
$ sudo cern-get-keytab --force
```

Next, install [the software][arc-server] that the central acron servers will 
talk to when an acron job should be run on the VM.

```bash
$ sudo yum install -y arc-server
```

(The central acron servers are managed by the CERN IT group.)

We need to open a hole in the VM's firewall for the acron messages to pass 
through.

```bash
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=4241/tcp --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
public (default, active)
  interfaces: eth0
  sources:
  services: dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports: 4241/tcp
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks:
  rich rules:
```

The last commands shows us that the port 4241 is now open, and it's this port 
that the acron communication takes place over.

We then need to disable the `dynroot` option of AFS (the shared filesystem used 
for user home directories and workspaces).

```bash
$ sudo sed -i"" "s/ \-dynroot//" /etc/sysconfig/openafs
```

Finally, we need to restart the `xinetd` service, which is responsible for 
handling traffic in to and out of our VM, just after adding the acron 
communication port to the list of known ports.

```bash
$ echo -e 'arc 4241/tcp\n' | sudo tee -a /etc/services
$ sudo service xinetd restart
```

Finally, reboot.

```bash
$ sudo reboot now
```

And that's it! Once the machine has restarted, we're ready to submit acron jobs 
to our VM.

## Using the VM for acron jobs

On lxplus, you can now edit the acron table file as usual, but this time you 
can specify the address of your VM as the host.

```
01 01 * * * acron-test.cern.ch date > date.log
```

This will run the command `date > date.log`, which saves the date and time the 
command was run to the `date.log` file. Acron jobs start in your AFS home 
directory, and so you'll see the `date.log` file there once the job has 
finished.

Try adding this job to your acrontab file with `acrontab -e`, setting the time 
to a couple of minutes in future, and then wait a few minutes to see if the 
file has been created.

### Editing the acrontab file on the VM

The `acrontab` program lives in `/afs/usr/local/bin`, but if you try to run 
that file on your VM, you'll get an error.

```bash
# Executed on the VM
$ /afs/usr/local/bin/acrontab -e
error in arc command, retrying.  Error message:
/afs/usr/local/etc/arc: error while loading shared libraries: libkrb4.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

I don't know what this means, and I don't know how to fix it. Seeing as you can 
still edit the acrontab file on lxplus it doesn't bother me, but let me know in 
[the comments][comments] if you have a solution.

## Summary

We've created a virtual machine that can be used to [run acron 
jobs][acron-tut]. Now, you can install any software you like on the VM, and 
use that software as part of your acron job. We'll see in a later post what 
sorts of cools things you might want to do.

To speed up the creation of your own acron VMsm I've prepared [a gist for 
setting up a VM for acron jobs][acron-gist] that you can upload to newly 
created VMs and run. It contains the list of commands in this post.
Once the VM has booted and you've run the script, you should be able to begin 
running acron jobs on it right away.
