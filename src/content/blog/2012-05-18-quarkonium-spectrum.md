As part of my degree I’m taking a computing course which requires two project reports. The second was on finding the roots of [the first Airy function](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AiryFunctions.html) in order to find the charm and beauty quark masses. The first one is in a [previous post](/2012/04/scattering-cross-sections/).

The report is written in LaTeX, the problem solving was done in Python, and the plotting was done with Mathematica. The [entire project is open source on GitHub](https://github.com/alexpearce/meson-masses).

Compiling
---------

The LaTeX document has a few dependencies.

1. `atlasphysics` which is bundled in the repository.
2. `siunitx` is found [here](ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/siunitx/). It’s a nice package which simplifies typesetting units.
3. Standard packages such as `amsmath`, `graphicx`, `subfigure` and `float`. I use the [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/) distribution for OS X, which ships with these packages by default (and ships with `siunitx` too).

You can view the [final compiled PDF on GitHub](https://github.com/downloads/alexpearce/meson-masses/Report.pdf).
