Every once in a while I buy a new VPS, mostly because I’m not entirely satisfied with my current setup. My stack of choice is usually [RVM](https://rvm.io/) for Ruby management, the [Apache web server](http://httpd.apache.org/), [Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/) for allowing Apache to run Ruby apps like Rails and Sinatra, and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) for the database.

This time around I decided to use some other software that seems to be popular with the community.

* For the webserver I chose [nginx](http://nginx.org). There are many [comparisons](http://www.wikivs.com/wiki/Apache_vs_nginx) of Apache and nginx, but for such a small-scale server as mine it really boiled down to curiosity.
* RVM has received [some flack](http://rakeroutes.com/blog/how-to-use-bundler-instead-of-rvm-gemsets/), principally because of [Bundler’s](http://gembundler.com/) ability to manage “gemsets” with Gemfiles. I went with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) to [manage my rubies](http://shapeshed.com/using-rbenv-to-manage-rubies/).
* I stuck with Passenger for allowing the web server to run Ruby apps. Although other solutions exist, like [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) and [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), the configuration required was a little too much for me.
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) is a popular choice these days. If it’s good enough for [Ryan Bates](http://railscasts.com/) then it’s good enough for me!

Now that the stack’s chosen, it’s just a case of setting it all up.

Setting Up Ubuntu
-----------------

In this section all commands are executed as the `root` user, as when you log in to a fresh install. If you’ve already got a user set up, prefix all the commands in this section with `sudo`.

I chose [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) as my Linux distribution of choice. The lastest Ubuntu image provided by my VPS host was 11.04, so first I had to update Ubuntu to the latest LTS, 12.04. First, make sure we’re up-to-date.

```bash
$ apt-get -y update
$ apt-get -y upgrade
```

The `-y` flag assumes a ‘yes’ response for all prompts. Next, as there’s no direct upgrade route from 11.04 to 12.04, we need to go via 11.10.

```bash
$ apt-get install update-manager-core
$ do-release-upgrade
```

Confirm that you want to perform the upgrade, and once that’s finished and the VPS restarted (`reboot`) Ubuntu will be at 11.10. You can check this:

```bash
$ lsb_release -a
...
Release:        11.10
```

Perform `do-release-upgrade` again to arrive at 12.04 LTS.

For a basic setting up of our VPS, the Slicehost article on [setting up Ubuntu](http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/4/30/ubuntu-lucid-setup-part-1) is great. In particular, make sure to set up the `wheel` admin group and get `iptables` set up. We’ll add a user to the `wheel` group later.

Once that’s done, we have a non-`root` user with which to log in to the VPS. Log in as that user from your local machine.

```bash
$ ssh user@12.345.23.91

Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 2.6.38-8-generic x86_64)
$ ...
```

Create a user to deploy with and add her to the `wheel` group.

```bash
$ sudo useradd -G wheel deploy
```

Where `deploy` is the username of our new user. Finally, we’ll install a few dependencies for later.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get -y install curl git-core python-software-properties build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline-gplv2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev 
```

Installing the Components
=========================

We have four main components to install: Ruby, PostgreSQL, Passenger, and nginx. We’ll install them in that order, as Passenger comes with a handy command that installs nginx from source for us.

To install Ruby we’ll install [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), which allows us to manage multiple rubies on the same machine. As `deploy` will be deploying the apps, we need her to have access to the rubies. Assume access as `deploy`:

```bash
$ su - deploy
Password:
```

And install rbenv using the handy [rbenv installer](https://raw.github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer/):

```bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
```

Add the snippet the installer gives you to your `.bashrc` and source the file in the shell.

```bash
$ nano .bashrc # or any other editor
...
$ . .bashrc
```

To make sure we’ve got all the dependencies required for installing Ruby from source, run `rbenv bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04`. We’ll install the latest version which is, at the time of writing, 1.9.3 patch 194.

```bash
$ rbenv install 1.9.3-p194
...
$ rbenv global 1.9.3-p194
```

The last command makes `1.9.3-p194` the global, default version of Ruby. You can check the Ruby version with `ruby -v`.

Now we have Ruby, we can install Passenger as a gem and then [refresh rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#section_3.6).

```bash
$ gem install passenger
$ rbenv rehash
```

Next, we install nginx.

```bash
$ sudo passenger-install-nginx-module
```

The installer will figure out if all the dependencies are preset. If they’re not, it’ll give you a snippet with which to install them. Choose option 1 to let Passenger download, configure, and compile nginx. The default installation directory `/opt/nginx` is fine, but some people prefer the more familiar Apache-like directory `/etc/nginx`.

Once that’s installed, we’ll get a script for nginx that allows us to use the `service` command, so we can do stuff like `sudo service nginx restart`.

```bash
$ sudo curl https://raw.github.com/JasonGiedymin/nginx-init-ubuntu/master/nginx | cat >> /etc/init.d/nginx
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
$ sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f nginx defaults
```

We’ll also replace the default nginx configuration with a leaner one. Download the [simple config file](https://github.com/alexpearce/templates/blob/master/nginx.conf) and replace the current one (backing up first, of course).

```bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/alexpearce/templates/master/nginx.conf | cat >> nginx.conf
$ sudo mv /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf.old # back up
$ sudo mv ./nginx.conf /opt/nginx/conf
```

Notice that this new configuration file `include`s files from `/opt/nginx/sites-available`. This is similar to how many people set up [Apache with virtual hosts](http://www.debianhelp.co.uk/virtualhosts.htm). For each site we want (generally represented as a (sub)domain or set of (sub)domains) we create a file inside `sites-enabled`.

If you installed nginx to a different directory, such as `/etc/nginx`, modify the `nginx` init.d and `nginx.conf` file to point to the right places. Check everything’s working by restarting nginx.

```bash
$ sudo service nginx restart
* Stopping Nginx Server...
  ...done.
* Starting Nginx Server...
  ...done.
```

We can double-check nginx is working by visiting our VPS IP.

Great! Now we have all we need to run Ruby apps. With something like Rails we need one one more thing though: a database. The version of PostgreSQL in the Ubuntu repository is a little outdated, so we’ll install it from an up-to-date [PPA](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ubuntu-ppa-technology-explained/).

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pitti/postgresql
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo install postgresql libpq-dev
```

`libpq-dev` is a dependency of the `pg` gem, which Rails will need to talk to the database. Now that PostgreSQL is installed, we’ll change the root password and set up a test user.

```bash
$ pqsql

postgres=# \password
Enter new password:
...
postgres=# create user test with password 'secret';
postgres=# create database test_production owner test;
postgres=# \q

$
```

Good, that’s everything for now. Let’s try getting a Rails app up and running!

Testing
-------

We’ll get a fresh Rails app going *as the deploying user*, so make sure you’re logged in as `deploy`.

```bash
$ su - deploy
```

We want each app to have its own set of gems. Using Bundler, we can do this easily [with a Gemfile](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9771172/rbenv-surviving-without-gemsets/9791080#9791080).

```bash
$ mkdir testapp
$ cd testapp
$ echo -e ’source :rubygems\n\ngem "rails"' >> Gemfile
```

We now have a Gemfile which Bundler can work with. We now install the `bundler` gem, install the stuff in our Gemfile to `vendor/bundle` (which will act as our app-specific gemset) and create the Rails test app.

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ rbenv rehash
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
$ bundle exec rails new . -d postgresql
```

Choose `Y` to overwrite our Gemfile with the Rails template. Now, install the rest of the Rails dependencies.

```bash
$ bundle install
...
Your bundle is complete! It was installed into ./vendor/bundle
```

To make sure Rails can talk to the database, edit `database.yml` with the test PostgreSQL user and database details.

```bash
$ nano config/database.yml
...
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: test_production
  pool: 5
  host: localhost
  username: test
  password: secret
...
```

The `host: localhost` is particularly important (and not in the default Rails `database.yml`); my app wouldn’t work without it.

Now we just need to tell nginx where our Rails app is. As I mentioned earlier, we’ve set up nginx so that each site has its own config file inside `nginx/sites-enabled`. I’ve uploaded a [test app config file](https://github.com/alexpearce/templates/blob/master/nginx.app.conf) on GitHub. We just download this to this nginx directory and **edit it** so that it points to the right place.

```bash
$ curl https://raw.github.com/alexpearce/templates/master/nginx.server.conf | cat >> testapp
$ nano testapp
... # edit the config file so that it points to our app
$ sudo mv testapp /opt/nginx/sites-enabled/
$ sudo service nginx restart
```

Visiting the VPS IP, it works!

Excellent. We’ve set up a VPS from scratch to serve Ruby applications, installing rbenv, Passenger, nginx, and PostgreSQL. If you’d like to test the Rails app a little further, delete `index.html` in the `public` directory and scaffold some models. Create, update, and delete a few records to make sure the database is OK.

```bash
# Inside the ~deploy/testapp directory
$ rm public/index.html
$ rails g scaffold post title body:text
$ touch tmp/restart.txt # this tells passenger to restart the app
```

That’s all for now, next we’ll go over deploying from a local machine to the VPS with [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano).
