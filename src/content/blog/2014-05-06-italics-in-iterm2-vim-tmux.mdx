Recently, I’ve been trying to restrict my coding workflow to the terminal.
I’ve always used [iTerm2][1] as my terminal, and, since switching to [vim][2] about 18 months, have used [MacVim][3] as my editor.
I felt I was losing efficiency switching between windows though, and losing power by not exploiting things like [splits][4].

Currently, my setup is using iTerm2 with [tmux][5] to manage terminal splits and ‘windows’, and then regular old vim to edit.
I like it, but the setup’s for another post.

This one is about enabling italics in these three tools.
MacVim has native support for italics, and although iTerm2 has [supported italics][6] for sometime, getting my italics back proved to be somewhat cumbersome.
I’ll explain what I did to get italics in iTerm2, tmux, and vim, as shown below, in this post.

The font
--------

In order to see italicised text at all, we need a typeface with a italic variant.
I like [Consolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas), which is included in all recent versions of Windows, and will be present on an OS X system if Microsoft Office has been installed.
If you don’t have it, you can probably find it online, or use a free typeface with an italic variant like [Ubuntu](http://font.ubuntu.com/) or [Anonymous Pro](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro). (There’s also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)">Menlo</a>, which is included with OS X.)

iTerm2
------

iTerm2 has support for italics built in.
First, make sure it’s enabled in your terminal profile.

![Where to enable italic text in iTerm2](/img/italics-in-iterm2-vim-tmux/iterm2-italic-text-setting.jpg)

Next, we need to tell the terminal what italic actually *means*, which is done by using a special [`TERM`][7] entry.
(This is not a subject I’m familiar with, but worrying about the technicalities here doesn’t seem to be necessary.)
Luckily, one has [already been made for us][8], courtesy of [Stefan Schüssler][9].

```
# A xterm-256color based TERMINFO that adds the escape sequences for italic.
xterm-256color-italic|xterm with 256 colors and italic,
  sitm=\E[3m, ritm=\E[23m,
  use=xterm-256color,
```

Create a file called `xterm-256color-italic.terminfo`, where ever you like, with the above contents.
This file needs to be processed and added to the `TERM` database.

```bash
$ tic xterm-256color-italic.terminfo
```

Finally, we need to tell iTerm2 to use this new `TERM`, `xterm-256color-italic`, by default.
This is done in the terminal pane of whatever profile you’re using.
The new entry probably won’t be in the list, but we can just type it in.

![Where to change the reported terminal type in iTerm2](/img/italics-in-iterm2-vim-tmux/iterm2-report-terminal-type.jpg)

If you close and reopen iTerm2, executing the following should show italicised text.

```bash
$ echo `tput sitm`italics`tput ritm`
```

If you don’t see italicised text, something else might be overriding the `TERM` environment variable.
Check its value is `xterm-256color-italic`.

```bash
$ echo $TERM
xterm-256color-italic
```

If it’s different, check you’re dotfiles (like `.bashrc`).

vim
---

I really like having comments in italic.
It differentiates them one step more from the surrounding code, and it makes sense semantically too, as a comment is treated very differently from anything else in the source.

To [enable italicised comments in vim][10], add this line to your `.vimrc` file *after* anything else theme related (like `colorscheme`).

```
highlight Comment cterm=italic
```

Then open up a new vim session and type a comment. Glorious.

You could also edit your colorscheme directly by changing the comment highlighting declaration.

tmux
----

If you open up a new tmux session, and then open vim, you’ll notice the italics aren’t working anymore.
This is because the `TERM` for a tmux session is, by default, different to that of a non-tmux session.


```bash
# Inside a tmux session
$ echo $TERM
screen-256color
```

To fix this, we need to install a new `TERM` entry, like we did before, and then tell tmux to use it.

So, as before, copy the contents below in to a file, this time called `screen-256color-italic.terminfo`.

```
# A screen-256color based TERMINFO that adds the escape sequences for italic.
screen-256color-italic|screen with 256 colors and italic,
  sitm=\E[3m, ritm=\E[23m,
  use=screen-256color,
```

If you squint, you’ll notice the only difference to the previous `.terminfo` is replacing all instances of `xterm` with `screen`.

Then, load this in to the `TERM` database.

```bash
$ tic screen-256color-italic.terminfo
```

Add a line to your `tmux.conf` to tell tmux to use the new `TERM`.

```
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color-italic"
```

I suspect there’s a cleverer way, but I had to kill my tmux process to bring the changes into effect.

```bash
$ killall tmux
```

Starting a new tmux session and opening vim, you should see what we’re after: italics!

Caveats
-------

If you `ssh` in to a remote machine from your tmux session, you might get some errors related to your new `TERM`.
This is because the remote machine doesn’t have the database entry we just installed locally.

To fix this, repeat the installation of the `xterm-256color-italic` and `screen-256color-italic` `TERM` entries.
(The `screen` entry isn’t necessary if you won’t be using tmux on the remote machine.)
We can extract the terminfo from our local database, and then upload it to the remote machine.

```bash
$ infocmp xterm-256color-italic > xterm-256color-italic.terminfo
$ scp xterm-256color-italic.terminfo user@remote:
$ ssh user@remote
# On the remote machine
$ tic xterm-256-italic.terminfo
```

Repeat for the `screen` terminfo.

You can delete the `.terminfo` files, from both the remote and local machines, once you’ve loaded them with `tic`.

tmux 2.1 and above
------------------

The release of [tmux 2.1][tmux21] saw several changes to the way tmux handles
the terminal type, amongst other things. For getting italics working, we now
need a *new terminfo* called `tmux`.

Luckily, there's already [an FAQ][tmux21-faq] on how to add the new terminfo entry with a single command.

```bash
$ cat <<EOF|tic -x -
tmux|tmux terminal multiplexer,
  ritm=\E[23m, rmso=\E[27m, sitm=\E[3m, smso=\E[7m, Ms@,
  use=xterm+tmux, use=screen,

tmux-256color|tmux with 256 colors,
  use=xterm+256setaf, use=tmux,
EOF
```

We then just need to tell tmux to use this new terminfo.

```
set -g default-terminal "tmux"
```

You might need to restart your terminal and/or the tmux server for the changes
to take effect.

Thanks to Landon Schropp for pointing this out in the comments.
