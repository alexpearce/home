Hi!

I spend a lot of time writing computer programs that try to solve interesting
problems, including statistical analysis, web APIs, optimisation, and developer
happiness.

I used to work as a research scientist at CERN on the [LHCb
experiment](https://lhcb.cern.ch), making measurements using data produced at
the Large Hadron Collider. I'm now a software engineer at
[Neuro](http://getneuro.ai) where we make GPUs fun again âœ¨

When I make something neat I put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexpearce),
and when I solve a problem that others might have I write about it here on my
[blog](/blog).

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Hello) if you have
any questions!
