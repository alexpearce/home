Hi!

I spend a lot of time writing computer programs that try to solve interesting
problems, including statistical analysis, web APIs, optimisation, and developer
happiness.

[Currently][linkedin] I’m the VP of Software at [Mystic AI][mystic] providing serverless
GPU resources for machine learning workloads.

Previously I was a high-energy particle physics research scientist at
[CERN][cern]. As a member of the [LHCb][lhcb] collaboration</a> I focused on
[charm][13tev] [production][5tev] and [matter-anti-matter asymmetry][cpv]
measurements as well as the experiment’s [real-time data processing systems][hlt].

When I make something neat I put it on [GitHub][github], and when I solve a
problem that others might have I write about it here on my [blog](/blog).

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Hello) if you have
any questions!
