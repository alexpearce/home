This my new blog. I plan to post solutions to problems I find my self in when I coding as a reference for myself, and for others.

The blog is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator. You can check out the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/alexpearce/alexpearce.github.com), along with a few other projects I have.

There are many wonderful resources I used to build this site, most of which I use on a regular basis.

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://h5bp.com) for solid HTML and CSS templates.
* [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) for the fonts I use here, particularly [Pacifico](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Pacifico) for the fancy logo and [Asap](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Asap) for headers. The body type is Palatino Linotype.
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for answering all my programming questions. I'm a [semi-active user there](http://stackoverflow.com/users/596068/alex).
* [Premium Pixels](http://premiumpixels.com) provide amazing quality PSDs for web design. Although I didn't use any for this site, it's worth the mention.

If you have any questions or suggestion, please feel free to ask.
